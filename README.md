## âœ… Final Tip

Once you add the `README.md`, your repo will:

- Show up cleanly on GitHub
- Be easy to share with friends, users, testers
- Let anyone install in 1 line

Let me know if you'd like to:
- Add auto-start on boot (`systemd`)
- Add version logging
- Or convert this into a Docker image too!
